/* so this basically my way of learning oops or how i learnt it 
made a simple library management system where while i code the stuff i also understand how i did soo*/


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

// so im learning oops concept hands on which would make my interview processes easier//

//class it is basically a blueprint for objects
// what is object? object is like a real entity which can be implemented in code

class Book{
    private: // it is one of the access modifiers  in this modifier the values or attributes to be exact which cannot be accessed publically or also can say as hidden data
    
    int id;
    string title;
    string author;
    bool isissued; // all these variables or parameters or attributes are private members of the class book;
    
    public: // another type of access modifiers where the attributes can be accessed by anyone 
    
    //now we make a constructor 
    // what is a constructor? it is a method used to initialze objects --
    // it has three types parameterized , non parameterized , copy constructor;
    
    // the one we use next is a parameterized constructor
    
    Book(int i, string t, string a){
        id = i;
        title = t;
        author = a;
        isissued = false; // default : book is available in the library
        
    }
    //now we initialze a getter method which is a method in encapsulation where u get the values of the attributes using funtions which are known as methods in oops
    
    //getter 
    int getId(){return id;}
    string getTitle(){return title;}
    string getauthor(){return author;}
    bool getstatus(){return isissued;}
    
    //now we initialze a setter method which as it says is used to set values for private attributes
    
    void issueBook() {isissued = true;}
    void returnBook() {isissued = false;}
    
    // now we display the book while hiding the internal representation (abstraction) 
    
    void displayBook(){
        cout<<"ID: "<<id<< "| Title: "<<title<<"| Author: "<<author<<" | Status: "<<(isissued ? "Issued" : "Available")<<endl;
    }
};

// now that marks the first important parts of oops it keeps getting better lets hang on

//lets create a base class for the inheritance process
// what is inhertance it basically means one class inherits or acquires the properties of a parent class
// a child class dervies its properties from its parent class

    protected: // this another type of access modifer whose attributes can only be accessed by derived classes

        cout<<"Generic user"<<endl;
    }
    string getname(){return name;}
    int getid() {return userId;}
};

// now lets create a derived class which inherits the attributes from parents class;

class Student :public User{
    public :
    Student(string n, int id) : User(n , id){}

    //overriding the virtual funtion or  redefining it 

    void displayRole() override {

    }

// another derived class that is librarian;

    //overriding virtual func again 

    void displayRole() override{
        cout<<"Role : Librarian"<<endl;
    }
};

//class library 
// concept we use here is abstraction whose basic use case is to hide data which is not be disclosed and show important data or attributes;
